# ATOM3D: Tasks On Molecules in 3 Dimensions

[![Documentation
Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/atom3d/badge/?version=latest)](http://atom3d.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)

ATOM3D enables machine learning on three dimensional molecular structure.

## Features

* Access to several datasets involving 3D molecular structure. 
* Sharded data format for storing lots of molecules (and associated metadata).
* Utilities for splitting/filtering data based on many criteria.

## Installation

Install with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
To use rdkit functionality, please install within conda:

```
conda create -n atom3d python=3.6 pip rdkit
conda activate atom3d
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To load a sharded dataset:

```
import atom3d.shard.shard as sh

# Load dataset split into fragments (or shards).
sharded = sh.Sharded.load('sharded/candidates/structures@21')

# Iterate through shards.
for shard_num in range(sharded.get_num_shards()):
  structures = sharded.read_shard(shard_num)
  # You can also load associated metadata.
  labels = sharded.read_shard(shard_num, 'labels')
```
